    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the  tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time. </p>
    <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken </li>
        <li>Corn Flour</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store. 

        </li>
        <li>Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken </li>
        <li>All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust. </li>
        <li>This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste. 

        </li>
    </ol>
